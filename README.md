RFID Controlled Smart Security System with Temperature-Based Fan Speed Control

Overview:
This project implements a smart security system using RFID technology along with additional features such as ultrasonic object detection, gas and fire detection, and temperature-based fan speed control. The system aims to enhance security and provide environmental monitoring in a controlled environment.

Components:
Arduino Uno: Acts as the central processing unit to control various sensors and actuators.
MFRC522 RFID Module: Used for RFID card detection and authentication.
Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects the presence of objects within a certain range.
DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor: Measures ambient temperature for fan speed control.
Servo Motor: Controls the opening and closing of a door or gate.
DC Motor: Regulates fan speed based on temperature readings.
Buzzer: Provides audible alerts for security breaches.
LDR Sensor: Detects ambient light conditions.
Gas Sensor: Detects gas leakage.
Fire Sensor: Detects fire or high temperatures.

Functionality:
RFID Authentication: Users can gain access to the secured area by presenting an authorized RFID card.
Object Detection: Ultrasonic sensor detects the presence of objects within a specified range, triggering security measures.
Environmental Monitoring:
Temperature Control: The DHT11 sensor measures temperature, adjusting the speed of the DC motor fan accordingly to maintain a comfortable environment.
Light Sensing: LDR sensor detects ambient light levels, enabling automatic light control.
Gas and Fire Detection: Gas and fire sensors provide alerts in case of emergencies.
Security Alerts: Buzzer activates in response to security breaches, such as unauthorized access, gas leaks, or fire detection.
Door/Gate Control: Servo motor controls the opening and closing of the door or gate upon successful RFID authentication.
